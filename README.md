For this task, I will be creating a Python script that scrapes course info from coursera.org

        In this project;
                1- Creating environment with => python -m venv env
                2- Activating env with => env/Scripts/activate (for Windows)
                3- Installing Django with => pip install django
                4- Crating project with => django-admin startproject main .
                5- Creating .env file for SECRET_KEY
                6- Installing requirements with => pip install -r requirements.txt
                7- Creating courseraScrap.py file to write our Scraping Codes
                8- Static file is for CSV files which we will download.
        
        P.S: Comments added to courseraScrap.py file for better understanding

Kind Regards,
